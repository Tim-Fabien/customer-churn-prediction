# Customer Churn Prediction Starter ðŸš€

## ðŸ§© Business Context
Customer churn is one of the most expensive challenges for subscription-based and B2C businesses.  
Every lost customer means lost recurring revenue **and higher acquisition costs** to replace them.  

ðŸ‘‰ The goal of this repo is to **show how to quickly prototype a churn prediction model** that can help marketing and retention teams act *before* a customer leaves.

## ðŸ’¡ What this project demonstrates
- End-to-end pipeline from **raw data â†’ ML model â†’ evaluation**
- **MLflow integration** for experiment tracking
- **Databricks/PySpark compatibility**, but also runs locally with scikit-learn
- Clean, modular code so you can swap in your own dataset

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **scikit-learn** for modeling
- **PySpark** (optional, for scalable data prep)
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- **pandas** & **matplotlib** for EDA & visualization
